             <p>Presidio is committed to sustainability across all facets of our operations. Actively working towards a greener and more sustainable future for businesses and communities, we’ve set the following goals to make a positive impact:
 
                 By 2025, we aim to significantly reduce e-waste generation through extensive recycling and reuse efforts. Our target is to increase our e-waste landfill diversion rate from 50% to 75% between 2022 and 2025.
                 Additionally, we’re dedicated to reducing our Scope 1 emissions (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles) by 20% by 2025. This will be achieved through a combination of strategies, including reducing our physical office space footprint and enhancing the energy efficiency of our buildings.</p>
